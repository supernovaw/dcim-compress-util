    <h1>Welcome to <code>dcim-compress-util</code>!</h1>
    <p>
        Assuming you are reading this, you might be wanting to use this program
        I've created geared toward my own preferences. You should be good to go
        as long as you have a UNIX-like environment with the <code>bash</code> shell
        and a few packages installed.
    </p>
    <p>Start by ensuring the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            all the images you want to start with are placed in
            <code>/static/files/orig/</code>,
        </li>
        <li>
            the images have consistent naming, no junk files (e.g. file names
            starting with <code>.trashed-</code>, other dotfiles),
        </li>
        <li>
            the directories <code>/static/files/workdir/</code> and
            <code>/static/files/result/</code> exist and are empty.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use the top navigation bar to proceed to the next step.</p>
